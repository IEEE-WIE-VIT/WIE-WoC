Baby, what'cha say?
I ain't here to, I ain't here to conversate
Baby, I don't play
From Miami, causin' trouble in LA
Rowdy, Tennessee
If I don't send for you, best not come for me
Jordan, 23
Guarantee you're gonna wanna leave with me
I got that la-la-la like

Pull up, pull up, pull up straight from Tokyo
You cannot believe it when we come through
Woo, my God, you look good today
Woo, my God, you look good today
Back up, back it up, back up, do it slow-mo
When she drop, it bounce back like a yo-yo
Woo, my God, you look good today
You look good today, yeah
Oh my God

Oh my God, yeah
Oh my God, you're awesome (Oh my God)
Oh my God, yeah
Oh my God, you're awesome (Oh my God)
Oh my God, yeah
Oh my God, you're awesome (Oh my God)
Oh my God, yeah

Ice cold, like my drink
Lose your concentration when you take a sip, yeah
Cyclone, make it spin
'Cause all I, all I, all I, all I do is win

Yeah I'm cut like a diamond, I'm cold
4 a.m., bloom like a rose
Girls like the summer, we're cold, oh
We got that la-la-la like

Pull up, pull up, pull up straight from Tokyo
You cannot believe it when we come through
Woo, my God, you look good today
Woo, my God, you look good today
Back up, back it up, back up do it slow-mo
When she drop, it bounce back like a yo-yo
Woo, my God, you look good today
You look good today, yeah
Oh, my God

Oh my God, yeah
Oh my God, you're awesome (Oh my God)
Oh my God, yeah
Oh my God, you're awesome (Oh my God)
Oh my God, yeah
Oh my God, you're awesome (Oh my God)
Oh my God, yeah

Oh my God, she's look right, though (You know you look right)
Me and you, that's a iso (Me and you tonight)
Waist so small, look like lipo (Like lipo)
Moonwalk, my diamonds Michael (Mi-Michael)
She so fine, I call my best man (Brrr)
Ain't no rings on her left hand (No rings)
I had a dream I was in quicksand (Dream)
Then I woke up with the best plans (Oh my God, yeah)

Oh my god, you're awesome
Smoke more green than Boston (Green)
I make a play and call 'em
Oh my God, she flossin' (Woo)
On the cover of magazines, I'ma crown the queen (Queen)
Bad and boujee, thick and pretty
I'm givin' her wet dreams (Ooh, yeah)
I'm the main reason why her friends like me (Hey)
Having her mad at me, tackle me like an athlete (Ooh, yeah)

Pull up, pull up, pull up straight from Tokyo
You cannot believe it when we come through
Woo, my God, you look good today
Woo, my God, you look good today
Back up, back it up, back up do it slow-mo
When she drop, it bounce back like a yo-yo
Woo, my God, you look good today
You look good today, yeah
