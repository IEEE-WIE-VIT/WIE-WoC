Bombs and guns explode, but you can't hear it (But you can't hear it)
If you look into my eyes, you might see it (You might see it)
'Cause looks can be deceiving when you got so much to lose
No bombs or guns are close, but I can hear it (But I can hear it)

My mind is a war zone
And my bunker's caving in
My mind is a war zone
And I don't think I'll win

My mind is a war zone
Oh-uh-oh oh-uh-oh oh-uh-oh
My mind is a war zone
Ah-uh-ah oh-uh-oh oh-uh-oh

Bombs and guns explode, but you can't hear it (But you can't hear it)
It's hard to find a light when you don't wanna see it (Wanna see it)
My days turn into night and I'm still drowning in my head
No bombs or guns are close, but I can hear it (But I can hear it)

My mind is a war zone
And my bunker's caving in
My mind is a war zone
And I don't think I'll win

My mind is a war zone
Oh-uh-oh oh-uh-oh oh-uh-oh
My mind is a war zone
Ah-uh-ah oh-uh-oh oh-uh-oh

I wanted to raise a white flag 'cause this battle is killing me
But I know I'm not the only one
'Cause everybody's got a battle to beat
Someone, anyone
This is a cry for help
I don't know if you can tell, but I' haven't been myself
I'm exhausted

My mind is a war zone
And my bunker's caving in
My mind is a war zone
Oh-uh-oh and I have to win Lyrics provided by Musixmatch
