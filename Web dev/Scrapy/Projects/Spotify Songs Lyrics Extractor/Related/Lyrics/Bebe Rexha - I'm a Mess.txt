Everything's been so messed up here lately
Pretty sure he don't wanna be my baby
Oh, he don't love me, he don't love me
He don't love me, he don't love me
But that's okay
'Cause I love me, yeah, I love me
Yeah, I love me
Yeah, I love myself anyway
Hey

Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be okay
It's gonna be a good, good life
That's what my therapists say
Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be just fine
It's gonna be a good, good life

I'm a mess, I'm a loser
I'm a hater, I'm a user
I'm a mess for your love, it ain't new
I'm obsessed, I'm embarrassed
I don't trust no one around us
I'm a mess for your love, it ain't new

Ooh, ah, ooh, ah, ooh, ah
Ooh, ah, ooh, ah, ooh, ah

Nobody shows up unless I'm paying
Have a drink on me cheers to the failing
Oh, he don't love me, he don't love me
He don't love me, he don't love me
But that's okay
'Cause I love me, yeah, I love me
Yeah, I love me
Yeah, I love myself anyway
Hey

Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be okay
It's gonna be a good, good life
That's what my therapists say
Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be just fine
It's gonna be a good, good life

I'm a mess, I'm a loser
I'm a hater, I'm a user
I'm a mess for your love, it ain't new
I'm obsessed, I'm embarrassed
I don't trust no one around us
I'm a mess for your love, it ain't new

Ooh, ah, ooh, ah, ooh, ah
Ooh, ah, ooh, ah, ooh, ah

Everything's gonna be alright, alright
Everything's gonna be just fine, just fine
It's gonna be a good, good life

I'm a mess, I'm a loser
I'm a hater, I'm a user
I'm a mess for your love, it ain't new
I'm obsessed, I'm embarrassed
I don't trust no one around us
I'm a mess for your love, it ain't new (yeah)
