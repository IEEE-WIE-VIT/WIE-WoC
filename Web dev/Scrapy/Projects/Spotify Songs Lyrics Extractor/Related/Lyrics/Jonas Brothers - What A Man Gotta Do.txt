Cut my heart about one, two times
Don't need to question the reason, I'm yours
I'm yours
I'd move the Earth or lose a fight just to see you smile
'Cause you got no flaws, no flaws

I'm not tryin' to be your part-time lover
Sign me up for that full-time, I'm yours
All yours

So, what a man gotta do?
What a man gotta do?
To be totally locked up by you
What a man gotta say?
What a man gotta pray?
To be your last "Good night" and your first "Good day"

So, what a man gotta do?
What a man gotta do?
To be totally locked up by you
What a man gotta do?
What a man gotta prove?
To be totally locked up by you

You ain't tryna be wasting time
On stupid people in cheap lines, I'm sure
I'm sure
So I'd give a million dollars just for you to grab me by the collar
And knock on these doors
These doors

I'm not tryin' to be your part-time lover
Sign me up for that full-time, I'm yours
I'm yours, woo

So, what a man gotta do?
What a man gotta do?
To be totally locked up by you
What a man gotta say?
What a man gotta pray?
To be your last "Good night" and your first "Good day"

So, what a man gotta do?
What a man gotta do?
To be totally locked up by you
What a man gotta do?
What a man gotta prove?
To be totally locked up by you

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Tell me what a man gotta do

So, what a man gotta do? (What a man gotta do?)
What a man gotta do? (What a man gotta do, yeah?)
To be totally locked up by you (Totally locked up by you)
What a man gotta say? (What a man gotta say?)
What a man gotta pray? (What a man gotta pray?)
To be your last "Good night" and your first "Good day"

So, what a man gotta do? (What a man gotta do?)
What a man gotta do? (Woah)
To be totally locked up by you (Totally locked up by you)
What a man gotta do? (Hey, baby)
What a man gotta prove? (What a man gotta prove?)
To be totally locked up by you (Totally locked up by you) Lyrics provided by Musixmatch
