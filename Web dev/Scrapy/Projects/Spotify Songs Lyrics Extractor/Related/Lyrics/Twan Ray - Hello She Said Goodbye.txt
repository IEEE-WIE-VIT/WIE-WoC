Hello She said
Hello She said
Goodbye

Oh I'm always in my head
Always talking to myself
People passing by and I
I'm just counting satelites

Then she looked at me she said
She said
Hello she said
Hello she said
Goodbye
Now she spinnin' in my head
My head
Hello she said
Hello she said
Goodbye

Oh I'm always in my head
Always talking to myself
People passing by and I
I'm just counting satelites

Then she looked at me she said
She said
Hello she said
Hello she said
Goodbye
Now she spinnin' in my head
My head
Hello she said
Hello she said
Goodbye

Then she looked at me she said
She said
Hello she said
Hello she said
Goodbye
Now she spinnin' in my head
My head
Hello she said
Hello she said
