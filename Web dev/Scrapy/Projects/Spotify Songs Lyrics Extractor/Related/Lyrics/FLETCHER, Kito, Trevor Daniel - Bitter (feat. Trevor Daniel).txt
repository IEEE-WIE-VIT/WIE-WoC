It's like, being on the outside of an inside joke
It's like, when they only got Pepsi and you really want Coke
It's like, finally get a text back and it's just your mom
It's like, when you just broke up and they play your song

I know I said it's kinda stupid
But it's just the way I'm feeling right now
And I hate that I can tell that someone's probably in my shoes
By now, right now

I know she thinkin' now she found herself a winner
I know you fucked her on the counter
Right before you cooked the dinner, yeah
I know you think about me when you kiss her
I left a taste in your mouth, can she taste me now?
That you threw out all our furniture and pictures
I bet you sugarcoated truth, I bet you're real sweet with her, yeah
I know you think about me when you kiss her
I left a taste in your mouth, can she taste me now?
I'm bitter

I'm bitter, I'm bitter, I'm bitter, I'm bitter

Hearing 'bout your new life and a brand new you
It's like, heard you got a new job but I heard you moved
It's like, I don't wanna hear it, don't wanna hear 'bout you
It's like I don't give a fuck
Yeah, I do

I know I said it's kinda stupid
But it's just the way I'm feeling right now
And I hate that I can tell that someone's probably in my shoes
By now, right now

I know she thinkin' now she found herself a winner
I know you fucked her on the counter
Right before you cooked the dinner, yeah
I know you think about me when you kiss her
I left a taste in your mouth, can she taste me now?
That you threw out all our furniture and pictures
I bet you sugarcoated truth, I bet you're real sweet with her, yeah
I know you think about me when you kiss her
I left a taste in your mouth, can she taste me now?
I'm bitter

I'm bitter, I'm bitter, I'm bitter, I'm bitter

You're still in my head but
You're not in my bed now
You're not in my bed now
You're still in my head but
You're not in my bed now
You're not in my bed now (oh, oh)

I know she thinkin' now she found herself a winner
I know you fucked her on the counter
Right before you cooked the dinner, yeah
I know you think about me when you kiss her
I left a taste in your mouth, can she taste me now?
That you threw out all our furniture and pictures
I bet you sugarcoated truth, I bet you're real sweet with her, yeah
I know you think about me when you kiss her
I left a taste in your mouth, can she taste me now?
I'm bitter

I'm bitter, I'm bitter, I'm bitter, I'm bitter

Oh, you know I'm bitter
