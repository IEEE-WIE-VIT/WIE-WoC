We could start a thing
Oh we could start a thing
Baby put your lips on mine
Baby put your lips on mine
She said she said
Come back to bed
And place your hand in mine
We could watch the world go by
Please come back and ease my mind

Baby, you're so stunning
You're so different
Spend my money
I won't miss it
I can't help myself
I can't help myself
Think of nothing else
Of nothing else yeah

We could start a thing
Oh we could start a thing
Baby put your lips on mine
Baby put your lips on mine
She said she said
Come back to bed
And place your hand in mine
We could watch the world go by
Please come back and ease my mind

Baby, you're so stunning
You're so different
Spend my money
I won't miss it
I can't help myself
I can't help myself
Think of nothing else
Of nothing else yeah

We could start a thing
Oh we could start a thing
Baby put your lips on mine
Baby put your lips on mine
She said she said
Come back to bed
And place your hand in mine
We could watch the world go by
Please come back and ease my mind Lyrics provided by Musixmatch
