# WEB DEV WITH PYTHON

## What is Web Development?

For those new to programming, you might be wondering what exactly web development is. Though it’s impossible to pinpoint an exact term, web development is loosely defined as building, creating, and maintaining websites. Typically, web development involves a frontend, everything that interacts with the client, and a backend, which contains business logic and interacts with a database.
What makes Python suited for web development?

## Advantages of developing web applications in Python:

- Easy to learn: Python is the most popular language for first-time learners for a reason. The language relies on common expressions and whitespace, which allows you to write significantly less code compared to some other languages like Java or C++. Not only that, but it has a lower barrier of entry because it’s comparatively more similar to your everyday language so you can easily understand the code.

- Rich ecosystem and libraries: Python offers a vast range of library tools and packages, which allows you to access much pre-written code, streamlining your application development time. For example, you have access to Numpy and Pandas for mathematical analysis, Pygal for charting, and SLQALchemy for composable queries. Python also offers amazing web frameworks like Django and Flask, which we’ll dive into later in the article.

- Fast prototyping: Because Python takes significantly less time to build your projects compared to other programming languages, your ideas come to life a lot faster, allowing you to gain feedback and iterate quickly. This quick development time makes Python especially great for startups who can hit the market sooner to gain a competitive edge.

- Wide-spread popularity: Python is one of the most popular languages in the world, with communities from all over the world. Because of how popular the language is, Python is continuously updated with new features and libraries, while also providing excellent documentation and community support. Especially for new developers, Python provides extensive support and framework for one to begin their developer journey.
A web framework is a collection of packages and modules made up of pre-written, standardized code that supports the development of web applications, making development faster and easier, and your programs more reliable and scalable. In other words, frameworks already have built-in components that “set up” your project, so you have to do less grunt work.

Python web frameworks are only utilized in the backend for server-side technology, aiding in URL routing, HTTP requests and responses, accessing databases, and web security. While it is not required to use a web framework, it is extremely recommended because it helps you develop complex applications in significantly less time.

### DJANGO

Django is a Python web framework that offers an open-source, high-level framework that “encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.” It’s fast, secure, and scalable. Django offers strong community support and detailed documentation. Django is incredibly flexible in which you can work with MVPs to larger companies. For some perspective, some of the largest companies that use Django are Instagram, Dropbox, Pinterest, and Spotify.

### FLASK

Flask is considered a microframework, which is a minimalistic web framework. It’s less “batteries-included,” meaning that it lacks a lot of features and functionality that full-stack frameworks like Django offer, such as a web template engine, account authorization, and authentication. Flask is minimalistic and lightweight, meaning that you add extensions and libraries that you need as you code without automatically being provided with it by the framework. The philosophy behind Flask is that it gives only the components you need to build an app so that you have the flexibility and control. Flask is also a prevalent and powerful web framework as it’s used by large companies like Netflix, Linkedin, and Uber.
Other notable frameworks:

### Pyramid
### Web2Py
### Turbogears

Some useful Python libraries for web development to keep note of:

### Scrapy
If you ever need a web crawler to extract data for your application, Scrapy is great for that. It’s a widely used library for scraping, data mining, automated testing, and more.

### Zappa
Zappa is a powerful library for developing a serverless application on AWS Lambda.

### Requests
Requests is a library that allows you to send HTTP requests easily, which is used to communicate with an application, allowing you to get HTML pages or data, for example.

### Dash
Another useful library is Dash, which helps those developing web applications that have to do with data visualization. Built on top of Flask, it offers features like charts, graphs, dashboards, and more.
