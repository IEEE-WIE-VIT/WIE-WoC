DESCRIPTION

This is a regression problem where we need to predict the price of Bitcoin Crypto currency. We use Linear, Lasso Regression and Decision tree Regressor

WHAT I HAD DONE

1. perfromed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the given dataset
2. it starts with loading the dataset and viewing the top 5 rows
3. we calculate statistical data in the dataset
4. then comes finding correlation between the features and also finding statistical values related to the dataset
5. data visualization is done with libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn
6. finally 3 different algorithms are used to find the best algorithm 
7. also accuracy score of each algorithm is calculated for comparison purpose with other algorithms

MODELS USED

1. Logistic Regression= simplest and most common algorithm used for classification problems
2. Lasso Regression
3. Decision Tree Regressor


LIBRARIES NEEDED

1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn
5. Scikit-Learn

ACCURACIES

1. Logistic Regression Score = 0.9994141897222906
2. Lasso Regression Score = 0.9992782274568394
3. Random Forest Regressor Score = 0.7965644733090571

CONCLUSION

We can conclude that Linear Regression gives the most accurate results specifically for this problem statement.
