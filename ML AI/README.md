# KaggleTitanicML
This repository contains my solution to the Titanic : Machine Learning from Disaster competition on Kaggle. This repository contains the dataset(both train and test) and my notebook for the same. 



# Contents of the Notebook
The notebook contains code,roughly, under the following points -
1. Introduction to the Problem
2. Looking at the data at a glance
4. Filling in missing values of the dataset
5. Outlier Handling
6. Exploratory Data Analysis
7. Feature Engineering
8. Performing the same operations on the test set
9. Model Creation using RandomForestClassifier

# About the classifier
 Mainly, for the Classifier, I have used K-Fold cross validation on the training set and using RandomForestClassifier, I got the least difference between the accuracy and the cross validation score.

 # Improvements
 I haven't tried hyperparameter tuning on this model, neither have I tried Stacking. Using these might improve the accuracy. 

 # My Favourite part
 My favourite part about the notebook would be the Exploratory Data Analysis part, where I used seaborn and matplotlib to plot a lot of different graphs to draw various insights from the dataset.
