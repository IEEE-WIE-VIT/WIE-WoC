**GOAL**

The goal is to predict Breast Cancer.

Dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data)

**WHAT I HAD DONE**
- Discussed some major columns on which cancer depends.
- Handling outliers of diagnosis columns. As, it is very important because at last we're predicting cancer.
- Then I used classification models present in sklearn to train the model.
- Use Correlation coefficients to measure how strong a relationship is between two variables.

**MODELS USED**
-  Logistic Regression

**LIBRARIES NEEDED**
- numpy
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

**CONCLUSION**
By using Logistic Regression I got 
 ```
    Accuracy of training data: 0.9076923076923077
    Accuracy of testing data: 0.9298245614035088
 ```
